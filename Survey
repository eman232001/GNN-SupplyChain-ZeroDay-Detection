# Literature Survey

This directory contains the structured literature survey and comparative analysis of research studies related to:

- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for software vulnerability detection
- Software Supply Chain Security analysis
- Zero-day and unknown vulnerability prediction
- Graph-based machine learning approaches for cybersecurity

The materials included in this directory provide systematic analysis and comparison of existing approaches through:

- Survey comparison tables
- Research paper categorization and thematic grouping
- Performance evaluation analysis (accuracy, datasets, and model complexity)
- Identification of research limitations and open challenges
- Mapping of existing studies to the proposed research framework

The contents of this directory directly support the Related Work and Literature Review chapters of the Master Thesis titled:

Graph-Based Adaptive Machine Learning Model for Identifying Unknown and Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Software Supply Chains.
